### **Abstract**

*In recent years DevOps has entered the stage of software development as a culture that promotes fast,
frequent and reliable software delivery. The culture has appeared as processes of continuous integration
and delivery have occupied a major role in software development procedures along with agile
methodologies for managing software development.*

*CI/CD has become part of any working process along with Agile management and DevOps culture. The
energy that used to be concentrated on the development of software functionality and its optimization
now flows into enhancing software delivery procedures. Companies are looking at how improved
processes and culture could give them an advantage over other businesses.*

*Docker is an open platform used for development, shipping, and running applications. It facilitates in
delivering software quickly as it separates applications from the infrastructure. Docker methodologies
promote quick shipping, testing, and deploying code anywhere, which reduces the delay between code
development and its deployment in production. It has a wider scope of benefits for both Developers and
System Administrators by allowing Developers to write code without having to worry about the system,
that it will ultimately be running on. Also, it potentially reduces the number of systems and offers
flexibility for the operations staff. This paper discusses the basics of Docker containers as well as related
work that is being carried out in this area. Further, the paper includes key use cases along with the
benefits and challenges involved in its usage*


### **Micro services Architecture**

## **Abstract**

*In recent years DevOps has entered the stage of software development as a culture that promotes fast,
frequent and reliable software delivery. The culture has appeared as processes of continuous integration
and delivery have occupied a major role in software development procedures along with agile
methodologies for managing software development.*

*CI/CD has become part of any working process along with Agile management and DevOps culture. The
energy that used to be concentrated on the development of software functionality and its optimization
now flows into enhancing software delivery procedures. Companies are looking at how improved
processes and culture could give them an advantage over other businesses.*

*Docker is an open platform used for development, shipping, and running applications. It facilitates in
delivering software quickly as it separates applications from the infrastructure. Docker methodologies
promote quick shipping, testing, and deploying code anywhere, which reduces the delay between code
development and its deployment in production. It has a wider scope of benefits for both Developers and
System Administrators by allowing Developers to write code without having to worry about the system,
that it will ultimately be running on. Also, it potentially reduces the number of systems and offers
flexibility for the operations staff. This paper discusses the basics of Docker containers as well as related
work that is being carried out in this area. Further, the paper includes key use cases along with the
benefits and challenges involved in its usage*


## **Micro services Architecture**

There is a couple of microservices which implemented **e-commerce** modules over **Catalog, Basket, Discount** and **Ordering** microservices with **NoSQL (MongoDB, Redis)** and **Relational databases (PostgreSQL, Sql Server)** with communicating over **RabbitMQ Event Driven Communication** and using **Ocelot API Gateway**.


We have implemented below **Features in this project**.

#### Catalog microservice which includes; 
* ASP.NET Core Web API application 
* REST API principles, CRUD operations
* **MongoDB database** connection and containerization
* Repository Pattern Implementation
* Swagger Open API implementation	

#### Basket microservice which includes;
* ASP.NET Web API application
* REST API principles, CRUD operations
* **Redis database** connection and containerization
* Consume Discount **Grpc Service** for inter-service sync communication to calculate product final price
* Publish BasketCheckout Queue with using **MassTransit and RabbitMQ**
  
#### Discount microservice which includes;
* ASP.NET **Grpc Server** application
* Build a Highly Performant **inter-service gRPC Communication** with Basket Microservice
* Exposing Grpc Services with creating **Protobuf messages**
* Using **Dapper for micro-orm implementation** to simplify data access and ensure high performance
* **PostgreSQL database** connection and containerization

#### Microservices Communication
* Sync inter-service **gRPC Communication**
* Async Microservices Communication with **RabbitMQ Message-Broker Service**
* Using **RabbitMQ Publish/Subscribe Topic** Exchange Model
* Using **MassTransit** for abstraction over RabbitMQ Message-Broker system
* Publishing BasketCheckout event queue from Basket microservices and Subscribing this event from Ordering microservices	
* Create **RabbitMQ EventBus.Messages library** and add references Microservices

#### Ordering Microservice
* Implementing **DDD, CQRS, and Clean Architecture** with using Best Practices
* Developing **CQRS with using MediatR, FluentValidation and AutoMapper packages**
* Consuming **RabbitMQ** BasketCheckout event queue with using **MassTransit-RabbitMQ** Configuration
* **SqlServer database** connection and containerization
* Using **Entity Framework Core ORM** and auto migrate to SqlServer when application startup
	
#### API Gateway Ocelot Microservice
* Implement **API Gateways with Ocelot**
* Sample microservices/containers to reroute through the API Gateways
* Run multiple different **API Gateway/BFF** container types	
* The Gateway aggregation pattern in Shopping.Aggregator

#### WebUI ShoppingApp Microservice
* ASP.NET Core Web Application with Bootstrap 4 and Razor template
* Call **Ocelot APIs with HttpClientFactory** and **Polly**

#### Microservices Cross-Cutting Implementations
* Implementing **Centralized Distributed Logging with Elastic Stack (ELK); Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana and SeriLog** for Microservices
* Use the **HealthChecks** feature in back-end ASP.NET microservices
* Using **Watchdog** in separate service that can watch health and load across services, and report health about the microservices by querying with the HealthChecks

#### Microservices Resilience Implementations
* Making Microservices more **resilient Use IHttpClientFactory** to implement resilient HTTP requests
* Implement **Retry and Circuit Breaker patterns** with exponential backoff with IHttpClientFactory and **Polly policies**

#### Ancillary Containers
* Use **Portainer** for Container lightweight management UI which allows you to easily manage your different Docker environments
* **pgAdmin PostgreSQL Tools** feature rich Open Source administration and development platform for PostgreSQL

#### Docker Compose establishment with all microservices on docker;
* Containerization of microservices
* Containerization of databases
* Override Environment variables
